        long-hint : |
            Trim the base-pairs from 3' end before alignment, if needed. By default, it is 0.
    np :
        ui-name : |
            Penalty
        short-hint : |
            Sets the penalty for positions where the read, reference, or both, contain an ambiguous character such as N.

description : |
    <p>This method aligns the sequencing reads for a set of two or more samples to long reference sequences of a genome using HISAT2 and outputs a set of alignments for the given sample set in BAM format. Alternatively, if the user has only a single sample of reads, this method will take single-end or paired-end library object instead of a sample set.</p> 
    
    <p>In addition, it outputs the alignment statistics such as total reads, mapped and unmapped reads, singletons, multiple alignments, and alignment rate in the table format.</p>
    
    <p>HISAT2 is essentially a successor of TopHat2 and is relatively faster and more sensitive while still maintaining low memory requirements. The HISAT2 index is based on the FM Index of Ferragina and Manzini, which in turn is based on the Burrows-Wheeler transform. The algorithm used to build the index is based on the blockwise algorithm of Karkkainen.

    <p><strong>NOTE:</strong> This method is one of the steps of the <a href= "http://kbase.us/rna-seq/"> KBase RNA-seq Pipeline </a>, however it can also be run standalone for one or more RNA-seq samples.</p>
